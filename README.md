## Overview and Origin
​
* Name of company

*Robinhood*

* When was the company incorporated?

*April 18, 2013*

* Who are the founders of the company?

*Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev*
​
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

*The Robinhood founders decided it was important to build products that would provide everyone access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy. Their previous experience in finance made them realize big Wall Street firms pay nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged commssion for every trade. They named the company Robinhood after the English outloaw who stole from the rich and gave to the poor.*
​
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

*In April 2017, Robinhood raised $110 Million at a $1.3 billion valuation led by Yuri Milner of DST Global, Greenoaks Capital, and Thrive Captial.*

*By 2020, Robinhood had raised $280 million in venture funding at a pre-money valuation of $8.3 billion led by Sequoia Capital.*
​
## Business Activities:
​
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

*Robinhoods original purpose was to attract people who deter from trading due to variuos trading fees, the complexity of the market, and the knowledge required in order to trade. Traditional Brokerages like Charles Schwab, ETrade and Merill Lynch require investors to go through multiple steps and guidelines before they make a trade. The level of complexity and knowledge required does not attract people to enter the investing space.*

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

*The Robinhood founders wanted to open up a trading platform that is easily accessible for young and inexperienced investors. This also includes traditianal investors.*

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

 *When Robinhood was founded in 2013, they announced its intention to make zero commision trading the centerpriece of its business offering. Traditional brokerage firms charged $10 or more for a trade. It also added features to make investing more like a game. New members were given a free share of stock. If you are already a trader on Robinhood, you can invite someone to the app and you will be rewarded a free share of stock. The app's user interface is also simple to use. The home screen has a list of trendy stocks like Facebook, Amazon and Apple. If a customer touches one of the stocks in the app, a green button pops up with the word "Trade", skipping many of the steps that other firms require.*

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

*Robinhood was mainly created by Python. 
They also use the following Applications:
Nginx, React, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu, Redis, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, RabbitMQ, Go, Kafka, Swift, Memcached, Kotlin, Django Rest Framework, Celery, Airflow, RaJava, Faust.*
​

## Landscape:
​
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

*Personal Finance*

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

*Ever since Robinhood entered the trading industry, "Mobile first" development is now the industry standard and all brokers with mobile apps reported significant increases in trades placed via mobile devices as well as overall customer engagement. Majority of customers prefer connecting via mobile device. Also, more traditional brokerages are aiming to cut down trading fees to retain customers. For example, JP Morgan You Invest App gave customers 100 commission free stock and ETF trades in the first year after opening an account.*

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

​*Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Merill Lynch, ETrade*
​
## Results
​
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

*The business impact of robinhood disrupted and revolutionized the brokerage industry. Robinhood's business model for trading stocks attracted more people into the investing space. Trading volumes have increased due to this new platform. Robinhood's hyper growth is being driven by an increase in trading volumes across the industry, combined with a surge in new customers. Unfortuanely, Robinhood fails to provide investors guardrails and techonology to support their customers. The ease of trading with no brokerage fees has drawn inexperienced investors into riskier trading. Half of robinhood's customers have never invested before.*
​
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

*Traditional brokerages measure success by the amount of accounts they retain and the total number of trades made per customer. Everytime a customer makes a trade, the brokerage makes profit. Robinhood encourgages investors to trade and their zero commision model allows traders to easily do that. In the first three months of 2020, Robinhood users traded nine times as many shares as ETrade customers and 40 times as many shares as Charles Schwab customers. In total, Robinhood makes $18,955 from the trading firms for every dollar in the average customer account. Options are the most lucrative for the company to faciliate by far. Options are complex securites that give people the right to buy or sell a stock a predetermined price. This has greater potiential for big gains or losses. Robinhood said it had 13 million accounts at the end of 2019 which was 10 million more accounts from the year before.*


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?​

*Robinhood reported they have 13 million accounts at the end of 2019 compared to Schwab (12.7 million accounts) and Etrade (5.5 Million). In the first three months of 2020, Robinhood users traded nine times as many shares as ETrade customers and 40 times as many shares as Charles Schwab customers.*


## Recommendations
​
 * If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

*I would advise robinhood to shift more into the banking industry. Currently they give the customers an option to have a debit card to use for payments and investments. Customers currently make 0.30% interest per month if they are enrolled in Robinhood's Debit Card program. It would be great to give customers more options like having a savings account, a credit card or introduce something like Robinhood Pay where they can get money back for every purchase. Since they have so many users, they should try to centralize all their customers banking info along with their investment portfolio into one location so they can compete with other Banks.*

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

*Shifting to the bank industry space will allow customers who already have Robinhood account to centralize all of their cash flows. Robinhood currently have customers enter in their bank account information so they can transfer money to the app to make investments. By allowing customers opening a bank account on the app, would make it easier for customers to keep track of all their bank activity in one place.*

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize and why they are appropate for your solution?

​*Robinhood already uses python for their mobile app and webiste so I would assume python will be used to create additional feature in the current app. I also believe incorporating machine learning will help Robinhood learn consumer behavior for banking and investing habits. This will help the company understand what consumers are drawn to.*
